Hey there,<br> 
I am a cybersecurity engineer. Currently working as a Security analyst in my current company. As part of my day to day job I work on incident response, malware, threat analysis and vulnerability management. I have a working experience of infra security, where I have worked on various network security devices such as Firewall, web proxy, loadbalnacer etc. 

Apart from my day to day job I love to hack. So I play CTFs and hunt bugs, though I am not that good(it's okay you can call me a noob) in this field till now. 

I love travelling a lot. Always I keep my backpack ready. I read books, play chess, love watching cricket and other sports. In sort I love to explore. That's all about me. To know more you can reach out to me. Thanks for reading <3.
